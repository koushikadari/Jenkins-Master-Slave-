Jenkins Master &amp; Slave 
ðŸš€ Hands-on Practice: Jenkins Master & Slave Setup with Web Application Deployment
Today, I explored Jenkins Master-Slave architecture and successfully deployed a web application on the slave server.
Hereâ€™s what I practiced:
>>Launched 2 EC2 instances â€“ one as Jenkins Master, the other as Slave-1
>>Installed Java 17 and Git on both servers
>>Configured Slave node in Jenkins Dashboard for distributed builds
>>Used Maven to compile, test, and package the application
>>Installed and configured Deploy to Container plugin for automated deployment on Tomcat in the slave server
This setup gave me deeper insight into distributed CI/CD pipelines and efficient workload distribution.
